2、查询"01"课程比"02"课程成绩低的学生的信息及课程分数

自连接
SELECT st.*,s1.`s_score` AS '01',s2.`s_score` AS '02'
FROM Student st,Score s1,Score s2
WHERE st.`s_id` = s1.`s_id` 
AND s1.`s_id`=s2.`s_id` 
AND s1.`c_id`='01'
AND s2.`c_id`='02'
AND s1.`s_score`>s2.`s_score`

长型数据变成宽型数据
SELECT s.*,t.s01,t.s02
FROM
(SELECT a.`s_id`,
MAX(CASE WHEN a.`c_id`='01' THEN a.`s_score` END) s01,
MAX(CASE WHEN a.`c_id`='02' THEN a.`s_score` END) s02
FROM Score a
GROUP BY a.`s_id`) t,Student s
WHERE t.s01>t.s02
AND t.s_id = s.`s_id`

3、查询平均成绩大于等于60分的同学的学生编号和学生姓名和平均成绩

通过and
SELECT st.s_id,s_name,score
FROM 
(SELECT s_id,AVG(s.`s_score`) AS score
FROM Score s
GROUP BY s_id) AS sc,Student st
WHERE sc.s_id = st.`s_id` 
AND sc.score>=60
通过group by having..注意where在前面
SELECT s.s_id,AVG(s.`s_score`) score,s_name
FROM Score s,Student st
WHERE s.s_id = st.`s_id`
GROUP BY s.s_id
HAVING AVG(s.s_score)>=60
通过子查询
SELECT s.s_id,AVG(s.`s_score`) score,
(SELECT s_name FROM Student st WHERE st.`s_id`=s.`s_id`) sname
FROM Score s
GROUP BY s.s_id
HAVING AVG(s.s_score)>=60
```

> 5.查询所有同学的学生编号、学生姓名、选课总数、所有课程的总成绩

```
SELECT Score.`s_id`,Student.`s_name`,COUNT(*),SUM(s_score)
FROM Score,Student
WHERE Score.`s_id`=Student.`s_id`
GROUP BY s_id
```
